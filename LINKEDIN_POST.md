🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Building a Medical Diagnostic RAG System using Retrieval-Augmented Generation!

🏥 **What I Built:**
A complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that analyzes patient cases and provides evidence-based diagnostic assessments using the MIMIC-IV-Ext Direct dataset.

🔍 **Key Features:**
✅ Hybrid retrieval combining semantic (FAISS) and keyword (BM25) search
✅ Real-time evidence retrieval from 115+ clinical documents
✅ Interactive Streamlit interface for querying and visualization
✅ Structured diagnostic outputs with confidence levels
✅ Robust fallback system for reliability

💡 **Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented dense retrieval using SentenceTransformers and FAISS
- Built sparse retrieval with BM25 for medical terminology matching
- Created hybrid scoring algorithm (α=0.7 dense, 0.3 sparse)
- Integrated TinyLlama for fast inference
- Developed keyword-based fallback for instant responses

📊 **What I Learned:**
- RAG architecture for domain-specific applications
- Medical AI ethics and responsible development
- Balancing model quality with inference speed
- Building reliable systems with fallback mechanisms
- User-centered design for AI applications

🎯 **Key Takeaway:**
RAG is powerful for medical AI because it combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with real-time access to clinical evidence, enabling transparent, source-cited diagnostic assistance.

⚠️ **Important Note:** This is an educational/research project. Always consult healthcare professionals for actual medical decisions.

**Shorter Version (if character limit):**

🚀 Just completed a Medical Diagnostic RAG System! 

Combined FAISS + BM25 retrieval with LLM generation to create an evidence-based diagnostic assistant using MIMIC-IV data.

Key learnings:
✅ Hybrid retrieval > single method
✅ Fallback systems = reliability  
✅ Medical AI needs transparency

Built with Python, Streamlit, Transformers, FAISS.
